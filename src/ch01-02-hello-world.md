# Hello, World!
Now that you have everything up and running, let's write our first program. Create a new `notebook` by clicking _new_ in the top right corner. 

In the first cell, type the following exactly how it is written here:

```python
print('hello world!')
```

Click the triangle play button at the top of the file or while the cursor is still in the cell type shift+enter. This will run the cell. The output `hello world!` should be displayed below the cell. You've just written and run your first python code!

In the following chapters we will be using this same technique, writting and running code to learn python!
