# Practical Programming with Python
### A friendly introduction to programming

Programming isn't as hard as you think it's going to be. It's not easy, but it's not hard. You'll find that with a bit of dedication and practice, learning to program might save you hours of time as you learn to automate some of your everyday tasks. 

My goal with this book is to get you writing code that will suit your needs as quickly as possible. Unfourtunatley though, as with anything new there is a bit of knowledge that must be obtained before you can dive right in. The first 8 chapters of this book cover all the basics and walk you through exercies to get you familar. I'm just gonna tell you right now, if you try and read this book, without doing any of the exercises, you won't learn how to program. 90% of programming is trying something, failing at it, and then googling how to solve your problem.  After these first few chapters, we will get into some of the most useful features of python, I hope you stick around until then!


## Some Background

If this is your first introduction to programming, welcome! I'd like you to know you've found the right place to start learning about programming. This guide includes a good grasp of practial programming but also includes information and explanations needed for beginners. 


#### So what is programming?

Simply put, programming is how we tell computers what to do. It's a series of commands we give to the computer so that it knows what shapes to display, what calculations to perform, what data to store, and so on. 

There are several components and terms that are useful to know before we dive in.

- **Program**: a set of instructions used to tell the computer how to do something. Google Chrome is an example of a program.
- **Code**: this term often reffers to the letters, words, and symbols that make up a program.
- **Programming Language**: the type or flavor of code that is used to write a program. Python is a programming language, Java is a programming language, and there are so many more. At their core they all do the same thing, they are a way to tell the computer what to do. Towards the end of this book, we will take a look at some of the other programming langues and discuss some reasons you might choose to use java over python, for example.

Back in the day, programming was fairly complex, programmers would have to write complex _code_ using old languages (the technical term is assembly code) in order to tell computers what to do.

Thankfully today we have cleaner clearer programming languages that make writing programs easier.
