# Getting Started

In this chapter we will get your computer set up to run some code and write our first program!


In the following sentences, I provide some information about what we will be setting up, but it's ok if you don't understand it all. Just know that in the next section we will get you all set up so you can run python code and write programs.


For the first part of this book, we will be using a tool called `Jupyter Notebook`. In the next section chapter we will walk through how to get that set up on your machine.


We will also be using python version `3.7` throughout this book so please follow the instructions in the next section to make sure you have the right version. We will be using `miniconda3` to manage our python version. For now, just follow the setup steps and I will explain more about what this is in chapter 7. TODO: explain about miniconda.
